A simple food ordering web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was a solo project to solidify my knowledge gained so far. Regarding design, I have followed a Figma file.
Users can add/remove menu items to their cart, view their total, and complete their order with a payment modal.

✨ Features

- Dynamic menu rendering
- Cart management: add or remove items with automatic price updates
- Order completion, payment form with validation
- Personalised thank you message after order


📚 What I learned with the help of this project

Building dynamic UIs with JavaScript DOM manipulation.
Working with arrays and objects (map, findIndex, splice).
Managing UI states (show/hide modal, thank-you message, empty cart).
Writing cleaner, modular, and reusable code.

🔮 Future Ideas/Improvements

- Persist cart in localStorage
- Add mobile responsiveness
- Integrate with a real payment API
